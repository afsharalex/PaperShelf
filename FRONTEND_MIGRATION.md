# PaperShelf Frontend Migration

This document outlines the migration of the PaperShelf application from static HTML pages to a React-based frontend.

## Overview

The PaperShelf application has been enhanced with a modern React frontend that provides the same functionality as the original static HTML pages but with improved user experience, code organization, and maintainability.

## Changes Made

1. **Created React Application Structure**
   - Set up a new `frontend` directory with a complete React application
   - Configured package.json with necessary dependencies
   - Set up public directory with index.html and manifest.json
   - Created src directory with React components and styles

2. **Migrated UI Components**
   - Created React components for each page:
     - Home: Displays feature cards and chat history
     - Upload: Handles PDF file uploads
     - Query: Provides interface for querying papers and viewing results
   - Implemented a shared Navbar component for navigation
   - Preserved the original styling and user experience

3. **Set Up API Communication**
   - Configured axios for API requests
   - Set up proxy to backend in development
   - Implemented API calls for sessions, uploads, and queries

4. **Added Docker Support**
   - Created a Dockerfile for the frontend
   - Added nginx configuration for serving the React app
   - Updated docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml to include the frontend service

5. **Created Documentation**
   - Added README.md with setup and usage instructions
   - Created test script for verifying the frontend

```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Production Mode with Docker

Run the entire application stack:

```
docker-compose up
```

Or for production:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Implement Jest tests for React components
2. **Enhance UI/UX**: Consider adding animations, transitions, and responsive design improvements
3. **State Management**: If the application grows, consider adding Redux or Context API for state management
4. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication if needed
